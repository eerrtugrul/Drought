                <h1> DROUGHT </h1>
                <p>A drought is defined as drier than normal conditions.
                    This means that a drought is "a moisture deficit
                     relative to the average water availability at 
                     a given location and season".A drought can last 
                     for days, months or years. Drought often exerts 
                     substantial impacts on the ecosystems and agriculture
                      of affected regions, and causes harm to the local economy.
